        <h4>She was more like a beauty queen from a movie scene<br>
            I said don't mind, but what do you mean, I am the one<br>
            Who will dance on the floor in the round?<br>
            She said I am the one, who will dance on the floor in the round<br>
            She told me her name was Billie Jean, as she caused a scene<br>
            Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of being the one<br>
            Who will dance on the floor in the round<br>
            People always told me be careful of what you do<br>
            And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts<br>
            And mother always told me be careful of who you love<br>
            And be careful of what you do 'cause the lie becomes the truth<br>
            Billie Jean is not my lover<br>
            She's just a girl who claims that I am the one<br>
            But the kid is not my son<br>
            She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son<br>
            For forty days and forty nights<br>
            The law was on her side<br>
            But who can stand when she's in demand<br>
            Her schemes and plans<br>
            'Cause we danced on the floor in the round<br>
            So take my strong advice, just remember to always think twice<br>
            (Do think twice, do think twice)<br>
            She told my baby we'd danced 'til three, then she looked at me<br>
            Then showed a photo my baby cried his eyes were like mine (oh, no)<br>
            'Cause we danced on the floor in the round, baby<br>
            People always told me be careful of what you do<br>
            And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts<br>
            She came and stood right by me<br>
            Just the smell of sweet perfume<br>
            This happened much too soon<br>
            She called me to her room<br>
            Billie Jean is not my lover<br>
            She's just a girl who claims that I am the one<br>
            But the kid is not my son<br>
            Billie Jean is not my lover<br>
            She's just a girl who claims that I am the one<br>
            But the kid is not my son<br>
            She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son<br>
            She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son<br>
            Billie Jean is not my lover<br>
            She's just a girl who claims that I am the one<br>
            But the kid is not my son<br>
            She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son<br>
            She says I am the one<br>
            You know what you did, (she says he is my son) breaking my heart babe<br>
            She says I am the one<br>
            Billie Jean is not my lover<br>
            Billie Jean is not my lover<br>
            Billie Jean is not my lover<br>
            Billie Jean is not my lover (don't Billie Jean)<br>
            Billie Jean is not my lover<br>
            Billie Jean is not my lover<br>
